# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

> **Note:** API keys for Gemini and Google TTS are now embedded directly in the code for development/demo purposes. You do not need to set up a `.env.local` file.
